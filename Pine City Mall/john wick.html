            <p>John Wick is a fictional character and the titular protagonist of the neo-noir John Wick film series. He is portrayed by Keanu Reeves. John Wick is a legendary hitman who retired until a gang invades his house, steals his car, and kills the puppy his late wife Helen had given him.</p>
            <p>John Wick is all about consequences. It'd be a lot easier to not skip “gym day” if you knew that in doing so an army of trained assassins would come to kill you. As the movie argues — rules are helpful because they are the only thing that separate us from animals.</p>
            <p>On cinema at 11:30 TO 12:40</p>
